# nordvpn-client
This is UNOFFICIAL KISS openvpn client (launcher) for Nord VPN. I have no affiliation with the Nord VPN company.

# Install
Put all the files wherever you want; change the corresponding variables in nordvpn.sh and run it by root

# Run

Run nordvpn.sh COUNTRY CODE by root

# Deps
Python 3 with requests module installed is required. You can install requests with or without using virtualenv. In case of global installation change the CMD variable to /usr/bin/python3 or something like that.

Anyway, if you choose this client instead of official one, you know what to do

Have fun
